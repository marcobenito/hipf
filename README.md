This project is a collaboration between 4 member as part of the Final Master Thesis for the Master of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from the Universidad Europea de Madrid in collaboration with IBM.

The project consists of evaluating the probability of a data scientist wanting to leave his/her current job.

The app consists of a small satisfaction survey that the employees can send, and a analytics dashboard where the results of the predictions, as well as some intersting KPIs are shown.
